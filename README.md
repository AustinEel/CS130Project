# PlanIt
An application for easily planning events with a group of friends.

## React Native application
To start development on the React Native application
- If yarn currently isn't currently installed on your machine, follow the instructions at https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable
- `yarn` - this installs all dependencies for the app and only needs to be run once (unless more dependencies are added by another contributor)
- `cd app`
- `yarn start`

The app can be run on your local device by downloading the Expo app for Android or iOS.

### React Native app structure
The `components` folder contains individually styled and reusable components. The `views` folder contains views to be used with `react-navigation`.

## Backend
TBA
